Villagers are now busy cultivating Jatropha, herbal and medicinal plants, generating power using bio-mass, engaging in food processing, and working collectively for their betterment.

He also stresses the importance of farmers protecting and nurturing the fertile land for the second green revolution, a goal that he believes can increase the agricultural GDP growth by atleast 4% per annum through the partnership of farmers and agricultural scientists and industries.  During his time at Rashtrapati Bhavan, he also facilitated interactions where visitors, including those from rural areas, were able to explore diverse gardens like the Mughal Gardens, the Herbal Gardens, the Spiritual Garden, the Musical Garden, the Bio-diesel garden and the Nutrition Garden.

He emphasizes the richness of his experience, shaped by interactions with people from all walks of life: politics, science, technology, academics, arts, literature, business, judiciary, administration, local bodies, farming, homemakers, special children, media, and most importantly, the youth and students, the \"future wealth of our country.\" Kalam engaged deeply with Indian society through interactions at Rashtrapati Bhavan in Delhi and across all states and union territories, including online.  \n",
      "\n",
      "A poignant encounter involved a young girl named Anukriti from Haryana, who questioned him about accelerating India's development. Her concern, shared by many young people, resonated deeply with Kalam. He assured her that her dream would be taken to the highest levels of government and that they would work towards it.  \n",
      "\n",
      "He recounts a unique experience in Khuzama village, meeting tribal village council members and discussing village progress and their dreams. He was especially happy to see an empowered village council functioning with financial powers and taking decisions, leading to a prosperous village with abundant fruit and increased vegetable production.  Villagers are now busy cultivating Jatropha, herbal and medicinal plants, generating power using bio-mass, engaging in food processing, and working collectively for their betterment.  This encounter, along with others, underscored the importance of nurturing the aspirations of the youth, particularly their desire for a developed India by 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kalam highlights key initiatives for national progress, such as empowering villages, mobilizing rural resources, strengthening agriculture, and fostering a spirit of resilience and collaboration in the face of challenges.   He notes how empowering villages, as exemplified by Khuzama, can transform India's 600,000 villages if all are given the tools and autonomy to succeed. This resonates with the theme of “bridging the rural-urban divide” by fostering sustainable development in rural areas. \n",
      "\n",
      "Adding to this understanding of rural India, Kalam shares a moving experience meeting more than 6000 farmers from various states and union territories at Rashtrapati Bhavan. During this meeting, he summarized the many practical suggestions given by farmers, emphasizing the urgent need to double agricultural production with reduced land, reduced water resources and reduced inputs. He also stresses the importance of farmers protecting and nurturing the fertile land for the second green revolution, a goal that he believes can increase the agricultural GDP growth by atleast 4% per annum through the partnership of farmers and agricultural scientists and industries.  During his time at Rashtrapati Bhavan, he also facilitated interactions where visitors, including those from rural areas, were able to explore diverse gardens like the Mughal Gardens, the Herbal Gardens, the Spiritual Garden, the Musical Garden, the Bio-diesel garden and the Nutrition Garden. These interactions showcased India's rich cultural and natural heritage.   \n",
      "\n",
      "This interaction further solidified his belief in the crucial role of agriculture and the need to empower farmers, working towards the principle of “Seed to Food” to improve the economic conditions of the nation since agriculture is the backbone of the nation.  He recalls a visit to Nagaland where he witnessed the potential for progress and emphasizes that a \"proud India\" should be the guiding factor in whatever profession individuals contribute.  Kalam specifically mentions his connection with fifteen lakh youth who represent the dreams of 540 million young Indians who aspire to live in a prosperous, safe and secure India. These young people are well connected among themselves and with urban societies, contributing to a strong and interconnected nation.  He calls for a youth movement dedicated to developing India by 2020, mobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness, and ensuring a brighter future for all Indians.  \n",
      "\n",
      "As part of this vision, Kalam draws inspiration from initiatives like the Periyar Maniammai College of Technology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore, which focuses on providing urban amenities in rural areas, demonstrating the potential for positive change through education and development.  He highlights the potential of projects like the PURA (Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas) complex, which connects 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs through physical, electronic, and knowledge connectivities, leading to economic and social development. Periyar PURA includes health care centers, primary to post graduate level education and vocational training centers,  resulting in large-scale economic connectivity and improved quality of life for the residents.  This initiative, alongside others, has fostered employment generation and the creation of numerous entrepreneurs, supported by 1000 self-help groups. Furthermore, two hundred acres of wasteland have been transformed into productive land, showcasing the transformative power of dedicated efforts.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The Periyar PURA complex also features running marketing centers that provide a sustainable economic development model for the whole region.  Kalam notes that students from the Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have worked with experts from the Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, demonstrating the potential for rural India to contribute to global development.  He cites examples of how students in Thanjavur district, leveraging their local competence and raw materials, developed internationally competitive prototypes for 55 lifestyle products with support from JETRO. These students also received valuable feedback from exhibitions in Delhi and Tokyo, further enhancing their innovative abilities. This co-operative venture has empowered the people of all 65 villages, enabling them to contribute to India's growth and development. Kalam further notes that similar PURA initiatives are being established across the country, emphasizing the need for 7000 such complexes to bring about widespread transformation. He encourages the development and production of internationally acceptable products from these rural hubs, contributing to India's economic and global standing.  \n",

During this meeting, he summarized the many practical suggestions given by farmers, emphasizing the urgent need to double agricultural production with reduced land, reduced water resources and reduced inputs. He also stresses the importance of farmers protecting and nurturing the fertile land for the second green revolution, a goal that he believes can increase the agricultural GDP growth by atleast 4% per annum through the partnership of farmers and agricultural scientists and industries.  During his time at Rashtrapati Bhavan, he also facilitated interactions where visitors, including those from rural areas, were able to explore diverse gardens like the Mughal Gardens, the Herbal Gardens, the Spiritual Garden, the Musical Garden, the Bio-diesel garden and the Nutrition Garden.

      "We have provided an existing summary up to a certain point: A.P.J. Abdul Kalam begins his farewell speech as President of India, expressing gratitude for his \"beautiful and eventful\" five-year term. He emphasizes the richness of his experience, shaped by interactions with people from all walks of life: politics, science, technology, academics, arts, literature, business, judiciary, administration, local bodies, farming, homemakers, special children, media, and most importantly, the youth and students, the \"future wealth of our country.\" Kalam engaged deeply with Indian society through interactions at Rashtrapati Bhavan in Delhi and across all states and union territories, including online.  \n",
      "\n",
      "A poignant encounter involved a young girl named Anukriti from Haryana, who questioned him about accelerating India's development. Her concern, shared by many young people, resonated deeply with Kalam. He assured her that her dream would be taken to the highest levels of government and that they would work towards it.  \n",
      "\n",
      "He recounts a unique experience in Khuzama village, meeting tribal village council members and discussing village progress and their dreams. He was especially happy to see an empowered village council functioning with financial powers and taking decisions, leading to a prosperous village with abundant fruit and increased vegetable production.  Villagers are now busy cultivating Jatropha, herbal and medicinal plants, generating power using bio-mass, engaging in food processing, and working collectively for their betterment.  This encounter, along with others, underscored the importance of nurturing the aspirations of the youth, particularly their desire for a developed India by 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kalam highlights key initiatives for national progress, such as empowering villages, mobilizing rural resources, strengthening agriculture, and fostering a spirit of resilience and collaboration in the face of challenges.   He notes how empowering villages, as exemplified by Khuzama, can transform India's 600,000 villages if all are given the tools and autonomy to succeed. This resonates with the theme of “bridging the rural-urban divide” by fostering sustainable development in rural areas. \n",
      "\n",
      "Adding to this understanding of rural India, Kalam shares a moving experience meeting more than 6000 farmers from various states and union territories at Rashtrapati Bhavan. During this meeting, he summarized the many practical suggestions given by farmers, emphasizing the urgent need to double agricultural production with reduced land, reduced water resources and reduced inputs. He also stresses the importance of farmers protecting and nurturing the fertile land for the second green revolution, a goal that he believes can increase the agricultural GDP growth by atleast 4% per annum through the partnership of farmers and agricultural scientists and industries. During his time at Rashtrapati Bhavan, he also facilitated interactions where visitors, including those from rural areas, were able to explore diverse gardens like the Mughal Gardens, the Herbal Gardens, the Spiritual Garden, the Musical Garden, the Bio-diesel garden and the Nutrition Garden. These interactions showcased India's rich cultural and natural heritage. \n",
      "\n",
      "This interaction further solidified his belief in the crucial role of agriculture and the need to empower farmers, working towards the principle of “Seed to Food” to improve the economic conditions of the nation since agriculture is the backbone of the nation.  Kalam recalls a visit to Nagaland where he witnessed the potential for progress and emphasizes that a \"proud India\" should be the guiding factor in whatever profession individuals contribute.  Kalam specifically mentions his connection with fifteen lakh youth who represent the dreams of 540 million young Indians who aspire to live in a prosperous, safe and secure India. These young people are well connected among themselves and with urban societies, contributing to a strong and interconnected nation.  He calls for a youth movement dedicated to developing India by 2020, mobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness, and ensuring a brighter future for all Indians.  \n",
      "\n",
      "As part of this vision, Kalam draws inspiration from initiatives like the Periyar Maniammai College of Technology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore, which focuses on providing urban amenities in rural areas, demonstrating the potential for positive change through education and development.  He highlights the potential of projects like the PURA (Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas) complex, which connects 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs through physical, electronic, and knowledge connectivities, leading to economic and social development. Periyar PURA includes health care centers, primary to post graduate level education and vocational training centers,  resulting in large-scale economic connectivity and improved quality of life for the residents.  This initiative, alongside others, has fostered employment generation and the creation of numerous entrepreneurs, supported by 1000 self-help groups. Furthermore, two hundred acres of wasteland have been transformed into productive land, showcasing the transformative power of dedicated efforts.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The Periyar PURA complex also features running marketing centers that provide a sustainable economic development model for the whole region.  Kalam notes that students from the Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have worked with experts from the Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, demonstrating the potential for rural India to contribute to global development.  These students also received valuable feedback from exhibitions in Delhi and Tokyo, further enhancing their innovative abilities.  This co-operative venture has empowered the people of all 65 villages, enabling them to contribute to India's growth and development.  Kalam further notes that similar PURA initiatives are being established across the country, emphasizing the need for 7000 such complexes to bring about widespread transformation. He encourages the development and production of internationally acceptable products from these rural hubs, contributing to India's economic and global standing. \n",

      "On the evening of February 24, 2007, at Coimbatore, Kalam had a “very beautiful experience” - meeting a man in a wheelchair with no hands and legs.

He  met all the school children and the village citizen of Urusa. The villagers apprised him of their losses and had all praise for Army and Air Force role in rescue and relief operations.

      "Kalam highlights key initiatives for national progress, such as empowering villages, mobilizing rural resources, strengthening agriculture, and fostering a spirit of resilience and collaboration in the face of challenges.   He notes how empowering villages, as exemplified by Khuzama, can transform India's 600,000 villages if all are given the tools and autonomy to succeed. This resonates with the theme of “bridging the rural-urban divide” by fostering sustainable development in rural areas. \n",
      "\n",
      "Adding to this understanding of rural India, Kalam shares a moving experience meeting more than 6000 farmers from various states and union territories at Rashtrapati Bhavan. During this meeting, he summarized the many practical suggestions given by farmers, emphasizing the urgent need to double agricultural production with reduced land, reduced water resources and reduced inputs. He also stresses the importance of farmers protecting and nurturing the fertile land for the second green revolution, a goal that he believes can increase the agricultural GDP growth by atleast 4% per annum through the partnership of farmers and agricultural scientists and industries. During his time at Rashtrapati Bhavan, he also facilitated interactions where visitors, including those from rural areas, were able to explore diverse gardens like the Mughal Gardens, the Herbal Gardens, the Spiritual Garden, the Musical Garden, the Bio-diesel garden and the Nutrition Garden. These interactions showcased India's rich cultural and natural heritage. \n",
      "\n",
      "This interaction further solidified his belief in the crucial role of agriculture and the need to empower farmers, working towards the principle of “Seed to Food” to improve the economic conditions of the nation since agriculture is the backbone of the nation.  Kalam recalls a visit to Nagaland where he witnessed the potential for progress and emphasizes that a \"proud India\" should be the guiding factor in whatever profession individuals contribute.  Kalam specifically mentions his connection with fifteen lakh youth who represent the dreams of 540 million young Indians who aspire to live in a prosperous, safe and secure India. These young people are well connected among themselves and with urban societies, contributing to a strong and interconnected nation.  He calls for a youth movement dedicated to developing India by 2020, mobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness, and ensuring a brighter future for all Indians. \n",
      "\n",
      "As part of this vision, Kalam draws inspiration from initiatives like the Periyar Maniammai College of Technology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore, which focuses on providing urban amenities in rural areas, demonstrating the potential for positive change through education and development.  He highlights the potential of projects like the PURA (Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas) complex, which connects 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs through physical, electronic, and knowledge connectivities, leading to economic and social development. Periyar PURA includes health care centers, primary to post graduate level education and vocational training centers,  resulting in large-scale economic connectivity and improved quality of life for the residents.  This initiative, alongside others, has fostered employment generation and the creation of numerous entrepreneurs, supported by 1000 self-help groups. Furthermore, two hundred acres of wasteland have been transformed into productive land, showcasing the transformative power of dedicated efforts.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The Periyar PURA complex also features running marketing centers that provide a sustainable economic development model for the whole region.  Kalam notes that students from the Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have worked with experts from the Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, demonstrating the potential for rural India to contribute to global development.  These students also received valuable feedback from exhibitions in Delhi and Tokyo, further enhancing their innovative abilities.  This co-operative venture has empowered the people of all 65 villages, enabling them to contribute to India's growth and development.  Kalam further notes that similar PURA initiatives are being established across the country, emphasizing the need for 7000 such complexes to bring about widespread transformation. He encourages the development and production of internationally acceptable products from these rural hubs, contributing to India's economic and global standing. \n",

      "The poem \"Sea Waves\" resonates with Kalam's message of resilience and overcoming challenges.

      "On the evening of February 24, 2007, at Coimbatore, Kalam had a “very beautiful experience” - meeting a man in a wheelchair with no hands and legs. The man, Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, introduced himself with a radiant face, revealing his happy state of mind.  I asked him, what could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in front of you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti “Entharo mahanubavulu” in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent.

He  met all the school children and the village citizen of Urusa. The villagers apprised him of their losses and had all praise for Army and Air Force role in rescue and relief operations.

This initiative, alongside others, has fostered employment generation and the creation of numerous entrepreneurs, supported by 1000 self-help groups. Furthermore, two hundred acres of wasteland have been transformed into productive land, showcasing the transformative power of dedicated efforts.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The Periyar PURA complex also features running marketing centers that provide a sustainable economic development model for the whole region.  Kalam notes that students from the Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have worked with experts from the Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, demonstrating the potential for rural India to contribute to global development.  These students also received valuable feedback from exhibitions in Delhi and Tokyo, further enhancing their innovative abilities.  This co-operative venture has empowered the people of all 65 villages, enabling them to contribute to India's growth and development.  Kalam further notes that similar PURA initiatives are being established across the country, emphasizing the need for 7000 such complexes to bring about widespread transformation. He encourages the development and production of internationally acceptable products from these rural hubs, contributing to India's economic and global standing. \n",
      "\n",
      "The poem \"Sea Waves\" resonates with Kalam's message of resilience and overcoming challenges. Just as the sea waves, though powerful, can be friends and inspire courage, the people of India, despite facing difficulties, can harness their inner strength and work together to build a brighter future.\n",

      "On the evening of February 24, 2007, at Coimbatore, Kalam had a “very beautiful experience” - meeting a man in a wheelchair with no hands and legs. The man, Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, introduced himself with a radiant face, revealing his happy state of mind.  I asked him, what could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in front of you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti “Entharo mahanubavulu” in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent.  What is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Kalam further exemplifies his belief in individual potential by sharing his visit to Urusa village in Jammu & Kashmir after the devastating earthquake in 2005. He found that the school building had been severely damaged, but the resilience of the people and the support provided by organizations like the Western Air Command of the Air Force, who delivered relief and medical aid, highlighted the spirit of unity and recovery.  He  met all the school children and the village citizen of Urusa. The villagers apprised him of their losses and had all praise for Army and Air Force role in rescue and relief operations.  The acting Chief Justice of Jammu & Kashmir was also present, demonstrating the collective commitment to rebuilding the community.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Kalam concludes by reflecting on this encounter, emphasizing the importance of recognizing and nurturing the potential within each individual. He stresses that regardless of physical limitations or societal barriers, everyone has the ability to contribute to the nation's progress.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Kalam also shares his experience visiting the Car Nicobar Islands following the 2004 tsunami, where he witnessed the community's resilience and the government's efforts in reconstruction and rehabilitation.  Even though there were many human losses due to the disaster, the tribal islanders demonstrated remarkable strength and unity, inspiring Kalam to highlight the importance of learning from such experiences and working together to build a stronger and more resilient nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "By sharing these diverse experiences, Kalam paints a hopeful picture of India's future, driven by the collective efforts of its people, particularly its youth and rural communities.  He leaves his audience with a message of optimism, urging them to work together to build a more prosperous and inclusive nation, inspired by the courage and resilience of the \"sea waves.\"  **As he concludes, all gather with him to sing the poem \"Sea Waves,\" reinforcing the message of unity and hope.** \n",

      "We have provided an existing summary up to a certain point: A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, in his farewell speech as President of India, expresses gratitude for his \"beautiful and eventful\" five-year term. He emphasizes the richness of his experience, shaped by interactions with people from all walks of life, including politics, science, technology, academics, arts, literature, business, judiciary, administration, local bodies, farming, homemakers, special children, media, and most importantly, the youth and students, the \"future wealth of our country.\"  \n",

      "Kalam engaged deeply with Indian society through interactions at Rashtrapati Bhavan in Delhi and across all states and union territories, including online.  He recounts a poignant encounter with Anukriti, a young girl from Haryana, who questioned him about accelerating India's development. Her concern, shared by many young people, resonated deeply with Kalam. He assured her that her dream would be taken to the highest levels of government and pledged to work towards it.  \n",
      "\n",
      "He highlights key initiatives for national progress, such as empowering villages, mobilizing rural resources, strengthening agriculture, and fostering a spirit of resilience and collaboration in the face of challenges.

      "\n",
      "Kalam also points to the benefits of technology, particularly its role in connecting India with Africa for societal transformation. This is exemplified by the Pan African e-Network project, which he proposed to the Pan African Parliament, connecting 53 African countries through satellite, fiber optics, and wireless technology.

      "We have provided an existing summary up to a certain point: A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, in his farewell speech as President of India, expresses gratitude for his \"beautiful and eventful\" five-year term. He emphasizes the richness of his experience, shaped by interactions with people from all walks of life, including politics, science, technology, academics, arts, literature, business, judiciary, administration, local bodies, farming, homemakers, special children, media, and most importantly, the youth and students, the \"future wealth of our country.\"  \n",
      "\n",
      "Kalam engaged deeply with Indian society through interactions at Rashtrapati Bhavan in Delhi and across all states and union territories, including online.  He recounts a poignant encounter with Anukriti, a young girl from Haryana, who questioned him about accelerating India's development. Her concern, shared by many young people, resonated deeply with Kalam. He assured her that her dream would be taken to the highest levels of government and pledged to work towards it.\n",
      "\n",
      "He highlights key initiatives for national progress, such as empowering villages, mobilizing rural resources, strengthening agriculture, and fostering a spirit of resilience and collaboration in the face of challenges.  He underscores the transformative potential of empowering villages, exemplified by Khuzama, where a functioning village council led to economic prosperity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kalam also points to the benefits of technology, particularly its role in connecting India with Africa for societal transformation. This is exemplified by the Pan African e-Network project, which he proposed to the Pan African Parliament, connecting 53 African countries through satellite, fiber optics, and wireless technology. This initiative aimed to strengthen tele-medicine, tele-education, and communication between leaders across the continent.\n",
      "\n",
      "During his time at Rashtrapati Bhavan, he facilitated interactions with farmers, government officials, and students, emphasizing the need to double agricultural production. He also showcased India's rich cultural and natural heritage through the diverse gardens at Rashtrapati Bhavan.\n",

      "Kalam draws inspiration from initiatives like the PURA (Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas) complex, connecting 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs through physical, electronic, and knowledge connectivities, leading to economic and social development.

      "\n",
      "His commitment to national defense was further solidified through interactions with internal security forces who are making immense contributions to the safety and security of citizens under difficult conditions. Visits to para-military forces, central and state police personnel, and locations like Urusa village in Jammu & Kashmir after the devastating earthquake of 2005, and the Car Nicobar Islands following the 2004 tsunami, reinforced his belief in the resilience of the Indian people and the importance of unity in overcoming adversity.   His visit to KUMAR in Siachen Glacier, experiencing firsthand the might of the Indian Armed forces through underwater and aerial adventures, further solidified this commitment.  \n",

He has witnessed many new adventures by institutions and individuals and is inspired by the ongoing development and progress of the nation.   He recognizes the progress made in the last sixty years, and above all he acknowledges the hard-working people, particularly the power of the 540 million youth of the country.
